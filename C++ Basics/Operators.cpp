/* operators in c++

1. Arithmetic operators

    A. Binary operators
        (+) Addition
        (-) Subtraction
        (*) Multiplication             //These operators perform mathematical operations
        (/) Division
        (%) Modulo 
        
    B. Unary operators
    
    (++) Incrementer                  //Both of these are of two types pre and post
    (--) Decrementer
    
    Syntax for pre Incrementer/Decrementer     ++<var> / --<var>
    Syntax for post Incrementer/Decrementer    <var>++ / <var>--
    

2. Relational operators

    (==) Gives true value if both operands have equal value 
    (!=) Gives true value if both operands are unqual
    
    (>)
    (<)             //Basic Mathematics comparison operators 
    (<=)
    (>=)
    
    
3. Logical Operators 

    (&&) And gives us true if both the operands are true, else false.
    (||) OR gives us true if atleast one of the operands is true.
    (!) NOT gives the opposite logical value of the operand.
    
    
4. Assignment operator 


    (=)  Assign value of right operand to the left operand 
    (+=) Assign sum of two operands to the left operand 
    (-=) Assign difference of two operands to the left operand
    (*=) Assign multiplication of two operands to the left operand
    (/=) Assign quotient of two operands to the left operand
    
    
5. Miscellaneous Operators

    {sizeof()}      Returns the size of a variable
    {condition?X:Y} Returns value of X if condition is true or else value of Y 
    {cast}          Converts one data type to another
    (,)             Causes a sequence of operations to be performed
    (&)             Returns the address of a variable
    (*)             Pointer to a variable
